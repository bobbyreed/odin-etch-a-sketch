            I think in like '23 I came across <a href="https://theodinproject.com">the odin project</a> for the first time. The <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch">Etch-A-Sketch project</a> is a challenge towards the ends of the foundations course. As I have taught web development undergraduate and grad courses, I have created this over and over. Each time, I try to not look at the previous code. This will not be true this time cause I got to clean up some gross css and make this presentable.

            I really do like coding. There are a million easy ways to make this thing, but I got a bug in my ear to try and make the knobs go. Here we go. So tonight I completed the grid and the resizing. I think I will remove the input and keep it to buttons only. No one wants to type. Next I need to build a pointer that can search by class and reset the class to a grid filled or whatever it is called form v1. Might as well reuse it incase I extend them so they will both work.
